This script can help you convert audio to text. Its output is a txt file in the folder where the script is located.

Sorry in case something misspelled my native language is Spanish

You can pass the name of the audio file through the command line if it is in the same script directory, it is also possible to pass the full file path.

Instructions:
You must have Python 3 and Python3-pip installed
Windows users
You just have to open the RunScript file, it will automatically search if there is a file with the name audio.wav otherwise you must enter a name in the CMD window that will open. Example: myaudio.wav or C: \ Users \ MyUserName \ Music \ myaudio.wav
Pressing enter and wait a moment until the program ends will leave a file in txt format

Linux users
Similar to windows users but you must open the terminal and go to the path where the script is saved, then place the name or full path of the file.wav and wait for a moment to finish the process.
